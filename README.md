# Introduction to jNano
jNano is a Java library used to interface with the official Nano node via RPC requests.
It also includes many native utilities and tools so that a node isn't always necessary.

Almost all of the features have been implemented, however it is still currently a work in progress.


## Usage
### Maven
This project is hosted on Maven Central. To import this library, add the following dependency into your pom.xml:
